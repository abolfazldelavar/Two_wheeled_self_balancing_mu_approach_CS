# Two Wheeled Self Balancing Robust Control ($\mu$ Approach)
In this case study, the dynamical model of a two-wheeled self-balancing mobile device has been proposed. Additionally, a $\mu$ robust controller for the device has been designed.

In order to run the simulation, just try to run [main.m](main.m).
